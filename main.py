# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

#     for filename in filenames:
#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# # One more important feature (Credit Mix) in the dataset is valuable for determining credit scores. 
# # The credit mix feature tells about the types of credits and loans you have taken.
# # As the Credit_Mix column is categorical, transform it into a numerical feature so that we can use it to train a Machine Learning model for the task of credit score classification:
