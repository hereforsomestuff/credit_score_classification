# credit_score_classification

Credit score classification refers to the process of dividing consumers into different credit risk categories based on their credit scores. 
There are several credit score classification systems in use, but the most widely used is the FICO score. 
FICO Score is a credit scoring model developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). It is one of the most widely used credit scoring models in the United States and around the world. The FICO Score is based on a consumer's credit report, which includes information about their credit history, such as their payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, and types of credit accounts. 
The FICO Score ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating a lower credit risk and a better credit history. 
Lenders use the FICO Score to help determine whether to approve a loan and at what terms, such as interest rate and loan amount. 
A high FICO Score can help a consumer get approved for loans and credit cards and may result in lower interest rates, while a low FICO Score can make it more difficult to access credit.
This system classifies scores into five categories, ranging from "Excellent" (800 or higher) to "Poor" (below 550). 
The FICO credit scoring model categorizes scores into the following five categories:

Excellent: A score of 800 or higher is considered "excellent" and indicates that the consumer has a strong credit history and a low risk of default.

Very Good: A score of 740 to 799 is considered "very good" and indicates that the consumer has a good credit history and a low risk of default.

Good: A score of 670 to 739 is considered "good" and indicates that the consumer has a fair credit history and a moderate risk of default.

Fair: A score of 580 to 669 is considered "fair" and indicates that the consumer has a limited credit history or has made credit mistakes in the past, resulting in a higher risk of default.

Poor: A score of 579 or lower is considered "poor" and indicates that the consumer has a poor credit history and a high risk of default.

It's important to note that these categories are not set in stone, and have been referred for this classification project but different lenders may use different criteria to determine creditworthiness. However, the FICO Score is widely used and provides a general understanding of a consumer's credit risk.These categories are used by lenders to determine a consumer's creditworthiness and likelihood of repaying a loan. Other credit score classification systems may use slightly different categories and scoring ranges.
Credit score classification is important because it provides lenders with a quick and easy way to assess a consumer's credit risk. This information helps lenders make informed decisions about who to lend money to and at what terms. A high credit score typically indicates that a consumer is a low risk and is more likely to repay a loan on time, while a low credit score may indicate a higher risk of default. Based on this information, lenders can set interest rates, determine loan amounts, and decide whether or not to approve loan applications. As a result, credit score classification plays a critical role in the lending process and has a major impact on a consumer's financial well-being.

Project Description: "Credit Score Classification"

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies consumers into different credit risk categories based on their credit scores.

Data: The project will use credit score data from a sample of consumers. The data will include information such as credit score, income, employment status, loan history, and payment history. This data will be collected from a variety of sources, including credit bureaus, banks, and financial institutions.

Methodology: The project will use a supervised learning approach to build the predictive model. This will involve splitting the data into training and testing sets, using the training set to train the model, and evaluating the performance of the model on the testing set. Several different algorithms will be explored, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to determine the best performing model. The model will be validated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results: The results of the project will be the best performing predictive model that can accurately classify consumers into different credit risk categories based on their credit scores. The model will be tested on new, unseen data to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

Conclusion: This project will provide valuable insights into the credit risk of consumers and will help lenders make informed decisions about who to lend money to and at what terms. The results of this project will have a major impact on the lending industry and will help consumers access credit more easily and at lower rates.
